# img2tiff

## Function
This tool can convert png/jpeg/gif images to tiff. 
It will checks if the file has been successfully converted to a tiff. Only if the new file is a valid tiff, it returns exit code 0.

## Usage
```
$ ./img2tiff <image file> <opt: new file>
```

## Notes
This is my first project I created in Go. I hope you like it :)
